with block 47 in the `feature_block.py` creates a block with a hash higher than the target, which is supposed to fail. Now two issues exist there, and both have low probability of showing up:\r\n\r\n1. The creation is done with `while (hash < target)`, which is wrong, because hash = target is a valid mined value based on the code in the function `CheckProofOfWork()` that validates the mining target:\r\n```\r\n    if (UintToArith256(hash) > bnTarget)\r\n        return false;\r\n```\r\n2. As we know the hash stored in CBlock class in Python is stateful, unlike how it's in C++, where calling `CBlock::GetHash()` will actively calculate the hash and not cache it anywhere. With this, blocks that come out of the method `next_block` can have incorrect hash value when `solve=False`. This is because the `next_block` is mostly used with `solve=True`, and solving does call the function `rehash()` which calculates the hash of the block, but with `solve=False`, nothing calls that method. And since the work to be done in regtests is very low, the probably of this problem showing up is very low, but it practically happens (well, with much higher probability compared to issue No. 1 above).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both these issues."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18349","id":581069436,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg4MTg2MDk4","number":18349,"title":"build:

behavior**\r\nI should be able to make the depends without an error.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe program extracts BDB, preprocesses BDB, and configures BDB (I think), then goes into a long list of \"checking\" lines (e.g. `checking for fopen... yes`).\r\n\r\nThe output shows `checking for clock_gettime monotonic clock...` then the error message below pops up (`The code execution cannot proceed because libwinpthread-1.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.`)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30005204/76664418-14010400-6563-11ea-9025-715f0968d9c9.png)\r\n\r\nI click okay and it outputs `no` for `checking for clock_gettime monotonic clock...`. The program continues running the checks and seems to finish building the depends normally.  I can then do the following:\r\n```\r\ncd ..\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nCONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nAnd it builds without error. But when I run `make check` I get the following output in the test-suite.log (showing the WalletTests failed):\r\n```\r\n********* Start testing of WalletTests *********\r\nConfig: Using QtTest library 5.9.8, Qt 5.9.8 (x86_64-little_endian-llp64 static release build; by GCC 7.3-posix 20180312)\r\nPASS   : WalletTests::initTestCase()\r\nQDEBUG : WalletTests::walletTests() TransactionTablePriv::refreshWallet\r\nQWARN  : WalletTests::walletTests() This plugin does not support propagateSizeHints()\r\nA crash occurred in \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\usr\\src\\bitcoin\\src\\qt\\test\\test_bitcoin-qt.exe.\r\nFunction time: 1440ms Total time: 1441ms\r\n\r\nException address: 0x0000000001568e55\r\nException code   : 0xc0000005\r\n\r\nStack:\r\n#  1: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n#  2: UnhandledExceptionFilter() - 0x00007fff0a61f4b0\r\n#  3: memset() - 0x00007fff0c8c3000\r\n#  4: _C_specific_handler() - 0x00007fff0c8ac640\r\n#  5: _chkstk() - 0x00007fff0c8c1100\r\n#  6: RtlRaiseException() - 0x00007fff0c889ef0\r\n#  7: KiUserExceptionDispatcher() - 0x00007fff0c8bfe60\r\n#  8: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n#  9: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 10: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 11: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 12: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 13: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 14: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 15: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 16: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 17: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 18: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 19: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 20: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 21: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 22: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 23: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 24: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 25: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 26: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 27: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 28: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 29: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 30: secp256k1_ecdsa_recover() - 0x0000000001e309a0\r\n# 31: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 32: Unable to obtain symbol\r\n# 33: BaseThreadInitThunk() - 0x00007fff0b8a7bc0\r\n# 34: RtlUserThreadStart() - 0x00007fff0c88ceb0\r\n\r\nFAIL qt/test/test_bitcoin-qt.exe (exit status: 5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this wallet error is caused by the first error (missing DLL).\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\nI get the error every time I run it on my system.\r\n\r\n1.

Let it run until the error message (screenshot above) pops up\r\n4. Click OK\r\n5. Let it finish building depends\r\n6. Run the following:\r\n```\r\ncd ..\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nCONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/\r\nmake\r\nmake check\r\n```\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n- Bitcoin Core master, built using instructions at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md\r\n- Windows 10 version 10.0.18363.719\r\n- Ubuntu 18.04 WSL (fresh install from Microsoft Store).

change to the QT font when displaying the address input on the 'Send' tab of the GUI to make it consistent with the rest of the form\r\n\r\nThis change involved removing the `setFont` function from being called in `setupAddressWidget` meaning it should use the default font instead\r\n\r\n`setupAddressWidget` is also called on the following files:\r\n\r\n- `editaddressdialog.cpp`\r\n- `sendcoinsdialog.cpp`\r\n- `sendcoinsentry.cpp`\r\n- `signverifymessagedialog.cpp`\r\n\r\nThis change works on all the above QT pages and helps neaten up the font consistency.\r\n\r\n**Linux
